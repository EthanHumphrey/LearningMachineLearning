My scholarship submission for WWDC19!

 # Hello!
 
![Welcome to my playground](LMLicon.png)
 
Welcome to my application for WWDC19. This playground will take you through the ins and outs of a technology called [machine learning](glossary://machine%20learning): a very powerful tool that can be difficult to understand. You will build the program on the right to detect what objects are shown through the camera.
 
Go ahead and try to scan objects and see how the label on the bottom of the screen changes. The type of objects you can scan are shown at the top of the view, so you can start by scanning different breeds of dogs. You can view information about the currently selected model by tapping the ( i ) button in the top left, and you can select a different model by tapping the button in the top right.
 
> If you don't understand what a model is, that's okay! This playground will take you through the basics of machine learning.
 
ðŸ”ˆ This playground has been designed with the visually impaired in mind! If you use VoiceOver, a switch will appear that will allow you to toggle a readout of what the model predicts.
